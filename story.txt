A stack of textbooks teeters precariously on the kitchen table. Worksheets litter the floor, scribbled notes competing for space with forgotten crayons.
A weary homeschooling parent stares at a complex science diagram, their eyes filled with confusion. Nearby, a child sighs, slumped over a history text dense with unfamiliar dates.
Another bounces impatiently, the promised art project ignored in favor of building a Lego tower taller than herself.
The parent glances at the clock, a desperate plea in their voice: "I love teaching you, but how can I possibly do this for all six of you at once?"
A chorus of "I'm hungry!" rings out, adding to the mounting sense of overwhelm.
The kitchen table groans under the weight of expectation, mirroring the weight on the parent's shoulders.  The end.
